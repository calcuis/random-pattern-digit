## random-pattern-digit (1-9)

The provided Python code generates a random pattern of digits from 1 to 9.

Here's a quick breakdown:

The `random` module is imported to generate random numbers.

A function `generate_random_pattern()` is defined.

A list of digits from 1 to 9 is created and shuffled.

The shuffled digits are joined into a string pattern.

The pattern is returned from the function.

The function is called, and the generated pattern is stored in `random_pattern`.

The generated pattern is printed.

In essence, the code generates and displays a different random pattern of digits each time it's run.
